--Objectives

-Evaluate sales performance across product categories.

-Understand customer buying patterns and preferences.

-Measure the impact of discounts and promotions on sales.

-Provide an easy-to-use dashboard for decision-making.

--Tools & Technologies

-Power BI ‚Äì Dashboard creation & visualizations

-Excel ‚Äì Data cleaning and preprocessing

-SQL (optional, if used) ‚Äì Querying & extracting insights

-Power Query ‚Äì Data transformation & integration

--Key Steps

-Data Preparation

Imported Blinkit dataset into Excel and Power BI.

Performed cleaning (removed nulls, duplicates, corrected inconsistent entries).

-Data Transformation

Used Power Query for aggregations, filtering, and creating calculated columns (e.g., total sales, discount impact).

Ensured data integrity with validation checks.

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identified category-wise contribution to total revenue.

Segmented data by regions, product types, and discount levels.

-Dashboard Development

-Heavy discounts increased sales volume but reduced profit margins.

-Certain premium categories showed strong demand even with minimal discounts.

-Seasonal spikes were observed in categories like beverages and snacks.

--Outcomes

-Built an end-to-end BI solution for retail data analysis.

-Helped simulate ‚Äúdiscount vs. profit‚Äù trade-offs for better pricing strategies.

-Demonstrated advanced skills in Power BI dashboarding, EDA, and storytelling with data.
